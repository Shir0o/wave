# Releasing Wave

This document describes the one-click release pipeline that ships Android
APK + AAB artifacts to GitHub Releases and to the Google Play Console
**internal testing** track. Production promotion remains a manual step in
the Play Console UI.

## How a release happens

1. A conventional-commit PR (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`) lands on `main`.
   The title carries the conventional-commit signal — release-please
   reads **PR titles**, not commit messages.
2. The `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` workflow opens or updates a
   **release PR**. The PR bumps `pubspec.yaml` (bare semver, e.g.
   `1.0.1`) and regenerates `CHANGELOG.md`. The Android `versionCode` is
   derived from the tag by the `release.yml` workflow at build time
   (`major*10000 + minor*100 + patch`, e.g. `v1.0.1` → `10001`).
3. You review the release PR (check the changelog draft and the version
   bump), then merge it.
4. The merge pushes a tag (e.g. `v1.0.1`). The
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow fires:
   - Assembles `key.properties` from secrets.
   - Derives the `versionCode` from the tag.
   - Builds a signed AAB and a signed APK with `--build-number=$vc`.
   - Attaches both to the GitHub Release for the tag.
   - Uploads the AAB to the Play Console internal testing track via
     `fastlane play_upload` as a **draft** (testers are not
     auto-notified).
5. **You** open the Play Console, verify the AAB on the internal track,
   and click **Promote release → Production** when ready.

That's the whole flow. There is no manual version bump, no manual tag,
no manual upload.

## PR title conventions (required)

The lint workflow `.github/workflows/pr-title-lint.yml` rejects PRs whose
titles don't match a conventional-commit prefix. Allowed prefixes:

| Prefix            | Effect                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `feat:`           | Minor bump; lands under "Features"    |
| `feat!:`          | Major bump; lands under "Features"    |
| `fix:`            | Patch bump; lands under "Bug Fixes"   |
| `perf:`           | Patch bump; lands under "Performance" |
| `refactor:`       | No bump; lands under "Refactoring"    |
| `docs:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `revert:` | Hidden from changelog (still allowed) |

`BREAKING CHANGE:` in the PR body footer also triggers a major bump.

## Prerequisites (one-time setup)

The pipeline needs seven GitHub secrets under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Secret                    | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN`    | PAT with `repo` (or fine-grained `contents:write` & `pull-requests:write`). **Required**: Tags created using GitHub's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` are suppressed by GitHub Actions and will never trigger the downstream `release.yml` workflow. A PAT is required for automated deployment. |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `base64` of the CI **upload** keystore.                                |
| `KEY_ALIAS`               | Alias of the upload key inside the keystore.                            |
| `KEY_PASSWORD`            | Password for the upload key.                                            |
| `STORE_PASSWORD`          | Password for the keystore file itself.                                  |
| `PLAY_SUPPLY_JSON_KEY`    | Contents of the Play Console service-account JSON (release-manager).    |
| `ENV_SECRETS`             | Contents of `.env` or empty fallback if none needed. Seeded into `.env` at build time. |

> **Important:** `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` is mandatory for end-to-end automation. While `GITHUB_TOKEN`
> has permission to create tags, GitHub's recursion prevention prevents tags created by `GITHUB_TOKEN`
> from firing downstream `on: push: tags` workflows. Always keep `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` set.

### Setting up keystore secrets via GitHub CLI

```bash
base64 -i ~/.keystores/my-key.keystore | tr -d '\n' | \
  gh secret set ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64 --repo Shir0o/wave
gh secret set KEY_ALIAS --repo Shir0o/wave --body "my-key-alias"
gh secret set KEY_PASSWORD --repo Shir0o/wave --body "<your-key-password>"
gh secret set STORE_PASSWORD --repo Shir0o/wave --body "<your-store-password>"
```

### Setting up Google Play and environment secrets

```bash
gh secret set PLAY_SUPPLY_JSON_KEY --repo Shir0o/wave < play-service-account.json
gh secret set ENV_SECRETS --repo Shir0o/wave < .env
```
